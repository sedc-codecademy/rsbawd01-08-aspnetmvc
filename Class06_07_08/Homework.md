## Day 08 Homework

Within the Order controller, implement the functionality 
of existing methods - actions.

Class calls from the business logic layer 
should be used during implementation.

Implementation of the functionality should be done 
so that the methods within the controller meet 
the needs for which they are intended.

### Advanced part - optional

Create views that are necessary for the full 
functionality of working with Orders.
